# Coding style

Non-dogmatic, mostly do what you want but sticking to the following conventions would be appreciated

- function_names
- Macro_Names
- Structs_And_Types
- COMPILE_TIME_CONSTANTS (including enum names)
- Using a single space between an identifier and the ::, : or := (this makes searching declarations easier)
