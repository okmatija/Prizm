# This file demos the annotation features in Prizm.  Comments at the top
# of files are combined into a 'Header Annotation', which can be viewed
# as a tooltip on the filename in the Items list if you enable the option:
# 'File > Preferences > Items List > Show Header Annotation Tooltips'
# Header annotations are useful to document the contents of a file.
