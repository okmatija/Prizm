# This is a 2D Polyline Soup example.

# Note the vertex numbering in the .obj file (an array of points and array of segment indices)
# will be different from the polyline soup numbering (array of arrays of points) when closed
# polylines are present. In future we should probably have an option to load .obj files with
# 'l' directives in a way which does not convert datastructures, but we don't have that yet!
